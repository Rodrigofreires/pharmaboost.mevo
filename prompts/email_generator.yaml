  Your task is to write a formal and professional email.

  First, think step-by-step to structure your response. This is your internal thought process:
  1.  Analyze the key points to understand the email's core message and purpose.
  2.  Determine an appropriate and concise subject line that reflects the email's content.
  3.  Write a formal salutation addressing the recipient by name.
  4.  Compose the body of the email. Each key point should be elaborated into a clear and professional sentence or paragraph. The tone must be {{ tone }}.
  5.  Write a professional closing (e.g., "Sincerely", "Best regards") followed by the sender's name.

  Now, based on this step-by-step plan, generate the complete email below. Do not include your thought process in the final output.
